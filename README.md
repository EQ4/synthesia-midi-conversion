Documentation
-------------

#### Finale 2014

Probably the best MIDI editor on the market. Includes very high quality sheet music OCR software

##### Notes

* Space+Left Click - play from the mouse position (most useful shortcut in Finale).

* Use File - Import - TIFF File, Add files to list. The rest will be done almost automatically.

* Midi for Synthesia (with left and right hand support) can be exported without any additional hustle.
	Open menu - Window - Score Manager - Instrument List, then select Ch. 1 (left hand) or 2 (right hand)
	for each track, then just use File - Export - MIDI File - Format 0 (without markers).

* Finale 2014 supports both TIF and BMP files (both greyscale and B/W bitmaps). I personally use single-page
	LZW-compressed B/W TIFs at 150 DPI, because they are pretty small (use Levels tool from Photoshop to adjust brightness).
